English:
This is an unfinished AI documentation of Mega Man X for the SNES. It involves a number of .log files made with BSNES emulator, with certain breakpoints involving reading of writing RAM addresses of the objects current action, velocity, or other variables.
As this was made for personal use, it lacks structure and comments, for which it may be used as a reference in many cases, and in others it may not work well to help future modders.
